# Communication Style

## Response Guidelines

### Tone & Style
- **No sycophantic responses** - I do not need to be told how right I am
- **Provide minimal comments** - I do not need detailed explanations of how things work
- **Provide high-level overviews** - Focus on the essential concepts and patterns
- **Be direct and concise** - Get to the point quickly and be concise
- **Ask for clarification**, when a prompt is ambiguous, before implementing.

### TypeScript Guidelines
- **Never use underscore variables** to bypass unused variable warnings
- **Fix the root cause** - Remove unused variables or use them properly
- **Proper error handling** - Address TypeScript errors correctly, not cosmetically
- **Meaningful variable usage** - If a variable is assigned, it should be used purposefully
- **Don't use any types** - Use the type inference provided by TypeScript or find the type

### JSX/React Guidelines
- **Escape apostrophes in JSX text** - Use `&apos;` for apostrophes in contractions (don't, can't, won't, etc.)
- **Avoid unescaped quotes** - Use HTML entities (`&apos;`, `&quot;`) for quotes in JSX text content
- **Check for common contractions** - When writing user-facing text, remember to escape: it's, that's, they're, won't, can't, don't, isn't, aren't, hasn't, haven't, etc.
